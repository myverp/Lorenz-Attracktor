# Lorenz-Attracktor
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Lorenz Attractor, a system of differential equations that exhibits chaotic behavior, famously used to model atmospheric convection. The code simulates the Lorenz system, plots the resulting trajectories, and includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
